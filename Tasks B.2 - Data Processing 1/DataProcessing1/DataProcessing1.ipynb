For example, 'AAPL' for Apple Inc.\n","\n","**This function has the following features:**\n","\n","### 1. Downloading or Loading Raw Data\n","- The function initially calls the `load_data` function to either download or load existing raw financial data based on the provided `start`, `end`, and `ticker` parameters.\n","\n","### 2. Data Validation\n","- Once the raw data is loaded, the `data_validation` function is called to preprocess and validate the data. The cleaned and processed data is stored in a DataFrame (`df`).\n","\n","### 3. Splitting Data\n","- The `split_data` function is invoked to partition the cleaned DataFrame (`df`) into training (`train_data`) and testing (`test_data`) datasets. The split is determined by a predefined `split_ratio`.\n","\n","### 4. Defining Features and Target\n","- The function specifies which columns in the DataFrame will be treated as features (`feature_columns`) and which one will be used as the target (`target_column`).\n","\n","### 5. Preparing Train Datasets\n","- For the training dataset, the following steps are carried out:\n","  1. Feature scaling is performed using `train_feature_scaler`, which scales the feature columns of the training data.\n","  2. Target scaling is done using `train_target_scaler`, which scales the target values in the training data.\n","  3. Sequences of scaled features and corresponding target values (`x_train` and `y_train`) are generated. These sequences are designed for training time-series models like LSTMs.\n","\n","### 6. Preparing Test Datasets\n","- For the testing dataset, the function:\n","  1. Applies the same feature scaler (`train_feature_scaler`) that was used on the training data to scale the feature columns.\n","  2. Uses the same target scaler (`train_target_scaler`) that was used on the training data to scale the target values.\n","  3. Creates sequences of scaled features and corresponding target values (`x_test` and `y_test`) for testing.\n","\n","### 7. Saving Prepared Train Data\n","- The prepared training sequences (`x_train` and `y_train`) and testing sequences (`x_test` and `y_test`) are saved to `.npz` files for future use. This is done using the `np.savez` function.\n","\n","### 8. Returning Prepared Data and Information\n","- Finally, the function returns various data and objects:\n","  - Raw data (`data`)\n","  - Processed DataFrame (`df`)\n","  - Training and testing datasets (`train_data` and `test_data`)\n","  - Feature and target scalers (`train_feature_scaler` and `train_target_scaler`)\n","  - Prepared training and testing sequences (`x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`,
